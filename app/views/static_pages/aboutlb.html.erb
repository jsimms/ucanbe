			<h3>About this box</h3>
			<p>This UCanBe box provides lessons and projects built around LittleBits. LittleBits is an opensource library of electronic modules that simply snap together with tiny magnets. A thriving community of creators and tinkerers ensure that there is no shortage of modules and project ideas. We curate projects, package all the materials and new modules, and ship everything to your door with helpful instructions.</p>

			<h3>Build your own self-driving car!</h3>
			<p>Our very first project based on LittleBits will ship on January 15th. We're working hard to put together a lesson plan so you and your child can do your best impression of Google engineers and build you own self-driving car. How cool is that?</p>

			<h3>We Handle Everything</h3>
			<p>We include all the LittleBit modules and other materials needed the month's activity. Included in the box are instructions for the parent with key learning points so you can put emphasis on the right steps as you work with your child.</p>
