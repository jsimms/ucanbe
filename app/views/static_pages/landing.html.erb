			<p>Using the littleBits building system&mdash;an award-winning, kid friendly electronic circuit system&mdash;learn the basics behind electronics, sensors, and more and how it applies to the future of transportation.</p>

			<p>Project Kit includes:<p>
			<ul class="icon">
			<li class="wrench">The body and wheels to use to build your first smart car</li>
			<li class="wrench">A Learn by Building guide with conversation starters, basic STEM principles, and cool factoids to electrify your conversation</li>
			<li class="wrench">Extensions and build challenges to get more wattage flowing to the creative half of your brain</li>
			</ul>

			<p><strong><span class="ectocooler">A BIG IMPORTANT NOTE.</span></strong> The littleBits Base Kit is required for project assembly and is sold separately. littleBits is a very flexible, modular set of circuits and electronics components that snap together with magnets. Think of the littleBits Base Kit as the necessary electronics skeleton, and and the UCanBe boxes as the flesh and muscles that bring your project to life.</p>
