			<p>The UCanBe Smart Car uses the LittleBits building system&mdash;an award-winning, kid friendly electronic circut system.</p>
			<p>Project Kit includes:<p>
			<ul class="icon">
				<li class="wrench">All creative materials specific to this project<sup>*</sup></li>
				<li class="wrench">Learning Guide with Conversation Starters, Basic STEM Principles, and cool Factoids to electrify your conversation</li>
				<li class="wrench">Dozens of Build Challenges to get the most wattage out of a single Project Kit</li>
			</ul>

			<p class="alert alert-warning"><sup>*</sup>Does not include a Little Bits Base Kit, sold separately. The Base Kit is a set of 10 color-coded Bits modules that snap together with magnets to create larger circuits. Think of the LittleBits Base Kit as the necessary electronics skeleton, and the UCanBe boxes as the flesh and muscles that bring your project to life.</p>
