			<p>The UCanBe Smart Car uses the littleBits building system&mdash;an award-winning, kid friendly electronic circuit system.</p>
			<p>Project Kit includes:<p>
			<ul class="icon">
				<li class="wrench">All creative materials specific to this project<sup>*</sup></li>
				<li class="wrench">Learning by Building Guide with Conversation Starters, Basic STEM Principles, and cool Factoids to electrify your conversation</li>
				<li class="wrench">Dozens of Build Challenges to get the most wattage out of a single Project Kit</li>
			</ul>

			<p class="alert alert-warning"><sup>*</sup>littleBits Base Kit is required for project assembly and is sold separately. littleBits is a very flexible, modular set of circuits and electronics components that snap together with magnets. Think of the littleBits Base Kit as the necessary electronics skeleton, and and the UCanBe boxes as the flesh and muscles that bring your project to life.</p>

			<p>SNEAK PEAK: Whatâ€™s to come in future Project Kits? How about Smart Car with Sensors; SmartClothes that light up; Bristlebot robots that move with vibration, SmartCrafts with electronics embedded, your personal security system and so much more.</p>
